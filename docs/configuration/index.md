# Configuration

prox uses [JSON5](https://json5.org) for configuration — a superset of JSON with comments, trailing commas, and unquoted keys.

## Structure

Every config has three sections:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    config.json5                      │
├──────────────┬──────────────┬────────────────────────┤
│   services   │   actions    │      resources         │
│   (WHAT)     │   (HOW)      │      (WITH WHAT)       │
│              │              │                        │
│  listen addr │  type: proxy │  inline text           │
│  tls on/off  │  type: static│                        │
│  routes[]    │  type: serve │                        │
│   └ match    │  timeout     │                        │
│   └ action ──│──► ref ──────│──► body_ref → resource │
└──────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────────────┘
```

**Key concept:** everything is reference-based. Routes point to actions by name, actions point to resources by name. But you can also inline them directly when a definition isn't reused.

## Services

A service is a listener with routing rules. Services can be defined inline or loaded from external files.

### Inline

```json5
{
  services: {
    my_site: {
      listen: ":8080",         // required
      tls: true,               // optional, default: false
      tls_cert: "/path/cert",  // required if tls: true
      tls_key: "/path/key",    // required if tls: true
      config: {},              // optional, per-service tuning
      routes: [...]            // required, at least one
    },
  },
}
```

### Service config

The optional `config` block tunes HTTP server timeouts and proxy transport behavior for a specific service. All values fall back to built-in defaults when omitted.

Durations accept strings (`"5s"`, `"1m30s"`, `"5m"`) or numbers (interpreted as seconds).

| Field                      | Default | Description                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `read_timeout`             | `10s`   | Maximum time to read the full request (headers + body)                      |
| `write_timeout`            | `30s`   | Maximum time to write the full response                                     |
| `idle_timeout`             | `120s`  | Keep-alive idle timeout before closing the connection                       |
| `response_header_timeout`  | `30s`   | Maximum time to wait for upstream response headers                          |
| `flush_interval`           | `0`     | How often to flush buffered proxy response data. `-1` = flush immediately   |
| `dial_timeout`             | action  | TCP dial timeout (defaults to the action's `timeout`)                       |
| `keep_alive`               | `30s`   | TCP keep-alive interval                                                     |
| `max_idle_conns`           | `100`   | Maximum idle connections in the connection pool                              |
| `max_idle_conns_per_host`  | `10`    | Maximum idle connections per upstream host                                   |
| `tls_handshake_timeout`    | `10s`   | TLS handshake deadline for HTTPS upstreams                                  |
| `h2_read_idle_timeout`     | `30s`   | HTTP/2: send ping after this idle period                                    |
| `h2_ping_timeout`          | `15s`   | HTTP/2: deadline for ping response                                          |

!!! tip
    For streaming protocols (SSE, long-lived HTTP, long-polling), set `flush_interval` to `-1` and increase `read_timeout`, `write_timeout`, and `response_header_timeout` to accommodate long-lived connections.

```json5
// Streaming-friendly gateway — long timeouts, immediate flushing.
{
  services: {
    gateway: {
      listen: ":443",
      tls: true,
      tls_cert: "/etc/prox/certs/",
      config: {
        read_timeout: "5m",
        write_timeout: "5m",
        response_header_timeout: "5m",
        flush_interval: -1,
      },
      routes: [...]
    },
  },
}
```

### File reference

A string value loads the service from an external JSON5 file:

```json5
{
  services: {
    web: "./web.json5", // load ServiceFragment from file
    api: "./api.json5",
  },
}
```

Relative paths are resolved from the **directory of the parent config file**.

### Directory reference

A string pointing to a directory loads all `.json5` files from it. Each file becomes a service named after its filename (without extension):

```json5
{
  services: {
    _microservices: "./services/",
    //  services/web.json5 → service "web"
    //  services/api.json5 → service "api"
  },
}
```

Non-`.json5` files and subdirectories are ignored.

### Directory mode (CLI)

You can also pass a directory directly to `-config`:

```bash
prox serve -config ./config/
```

Every `.json5` file in the directory is treated as a service fragment. No root config file is needed.

## Service Fragments

A service fragment is the file format for external service definitions. It's a service definition with optional local `actions` and `resources`:

```json5
// web.json5
{
  listen: ":8080",
  routes: [
    { match: { path: "/health" }, action: "health" },
    { match: { path: "/*" }, action: "frontend" },
  ],

  // Local actions — merged into the global pool.
  actions: {
    frontend: { type: "serve", root: "./public" },
  },

  // Local resources — merged into the global pool.
  resources: {
    banner: { text: "Welcome!" },
  },
}
```

**Merge rules:**

- Actions and resources from fragments are merged into the global pool alongside definitions from the root config.
- Duplicate names across any files are a **validation error** — rename to avoid collisions.
- Global actions from the root config are accessible by all services (e.g. a shared `health` action).
- Fragments cannot reference other files — only one level of nesting.

## Validation

Validate before deploying:

```bash
prox validate -config config.json5
prox validate -config ./config/      # works with directories too
```

The validator checks:

- All action references resolve
- All resource references resolve
- Required fields are present
- HTTP methods are valid
- Path patterns are well-formed
- Domain patterns are well-formed (at most one `*` per segment, at least 2 segments, `**` only at end)
- At least one of `path` or `domain` in each route (or omit `match` for catch-all)
- TLS cert/key are provided when TLS is enabled
- `pass` routes require a `domain` (SNI matching) and cannot use `path` or `methods`
- `pass` actions require an `upstream`
- Balancer type is valid (`roundrobin`, `random`, or `leastconn`)
- Balancer targets are non-empty and unique (empty allowed with plugins)
- Balancer is only used with `proxy` or `pass` actions
- Action upstream contains `{target}` when a balancer is used
- Plugin paths are non-empty
- No duplicate action/resource names across files
- No circular file references
- Reports **all** issues at once
